The contents of this directory are not mine in any way. As the name implies, these are 
third party dependencies (at the time of this writing, Ceres and Glog)
Furthermore, they will probably not work in your system, you may need to recompile the
libraries from the source.

I'm adding them to the repository as a backup of my working copy and as a reminder of where
qmake / make expect them to be.
